## Products that need reordering, continued

### Exercice:

Now we need to incorporate these fields—UnitsInStock, UnitsOnOrder, ReorderLevel, Discontinued—into our calculation. We’ll define "products that need reordering" with the following:
- UnitsInStock plus UnitsOnOrder are less than or equal to ReorderLevel
- The Discontinued flag is false (0)

### Expected Results:

| ProductID |    ProductName     | UnitsInStock | UnitsOnOrder | ReorderLevel | Discontinued |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|     30    | Nord-Ost Matjeshering |      10      |      70      |      15      |      0       |
|           |     Outback Lager       |      15      |      0       |      10      |      15      |
|     30    |          0           |       0      |       0      |      30      |      0       |

### Hint

For the first part of the Where clause, you should have something like this:
UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder <= ReorderLevel
